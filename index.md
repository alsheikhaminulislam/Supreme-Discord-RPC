 <h2>🔽 Make sure to read all the way down! 🔽</h2>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Click the purple "Developer Portal" button</li>
    <li>Sign in to your Discord account</li>
    <li>Click "New Application", and give it a name! This will be the display name of your presence.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Head over to the "Rich Presence" tab, and click the upload button to upload images. Give them short,
        descriptive names.</li>
    <li>Close the Developer Portal window.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Head back to the main application.</li>
    <li>Give your presence a file name (doesn't have to be same as the app name).</li>
    <li>Paste into Client ID. If you were in the developer portal from step 1, it should've copied automatically.</li>
    <li>Fill out the rest of the fields as much as you want.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Refer to the diagram below if you're confused!</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Click the "Save" button</li>
    <li>Click the "Launch Presence" button, and watch your presence spring to life!
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure Discord is open before clicking the button.</li>
            <li>It has to be the Desktop app, not the website.</li>
            <li>If your presence doesn't show up...</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure your status isn't invisible/offline.</li>
                <li>Make sure game activity is on in Discord's settings.</li>
                <li>Make sure you clicked the "Save" button before you clicked the "Launch Presence" button.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Custom theming</h2>
<p>If you notice in settings (bottom right gear icon), the last option for themes is "Custom". To make a custom theme:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go back to the main screen</li>
    <li>Click the "Show in files" button</li>
    <li>Edit and save the custom.css file. The colors are in the 6-letter hex format. More advanced editing requires
        basic CSS knowledge.</li>
    <li>Select Custom from the bottom of the theme list.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CLI Instructions</h2>
<p>For users that know what they're doing, you can run
    <code> discordrpcmaker <span>&#60;</span>file<span>&#62;</span></file></code> in the terminal, where
    <code>file</code> is the file name of the presence you want to launch, which can be found under each presence name
    on the sidebar.</p>

<h2>Common issues</h2>
<h3>Help, I'm confused and followed the run from source instructions!</h3>
<p>There was a big warning there for a reason. Go back and read the regular install instructions, ya goober.</p>
<h3>My buttons aren't working!</h3>
<p>Discord doesn't let you click your own buttons. However, everyone else can. This is a limitation with Discord.</p>
<h3>I can't see the presence!</h3>
<p>Make sure you are not invisible/offline. If you ARE online/idle/dnd...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you don't have another program taking up a presence slot.</li>
    <li>Go to Settings > Game Activity > Make sure "Display currently running game as a status message" is ON.</li>
    <li>THERE IS A KNOWN BUG IN macOS 11, where sometimes you can't see your own presence. However, other people can.
        This is a problem with Discord's macOS 11 client, not my program.</li>
    <li>If all else fails, completely close and relaunch Discord.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The image(s) aren't showing!</h3>
<p>If you just put them in, sometimes Discord takes a minute or so to cache them properly.</p>
